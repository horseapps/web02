<p>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION
Information provided by your mobile device 
Like many other applications, we may record information that your mobile device routinely shares, such as the date and time you accessed the App and the features of the App that you use. This will generally be anonymous data that we collect on an aggregate basis. We will not try to associate anonymous data with the personal information that you provide to us, except to investigate apparent fraud or a threat to our App, our business or our users.  Additionally, we may use geographic location information provided by your mobile device to identify products and services available in your vicinity. We do not collect or store your geographic information except to provide this service.</p>

<p>Personal information that you provide 
We may also collect personal information that you choose to provide to us on a voluntary basis. When we ask for your personal information, it is so that we and third parties can provide a product or service to you and communicate with you about those products and services. For example, you can register on our App by providing us with your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address, and then elect to receive e-mails or receive notifications about new products and services. It will always be your choice whether to provide your personal information to take advantage of these features.  You understand that sharing such information is completely voluntary.  Horse Apps assumes no liability for such information.</p>

<p>We may also offer certain social networking and marketplace features on this App, such as the opportunity to solicit products and services and to post comments or opinions about products and services.

<p>USE OF COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY
Tracking on our own App 
As is commonly done on websites and applications, we may use cookies and similar technology to keep track of our users and the services they have elected. A "cookie" is a small text file containing alphanumeric characters that is stored on your computer or mobile device and uniquely identifies your browser. If you have created a user name and account, we will use cookies so that when you return to our App we can remember who you are and your preferences. We may allow business partners who provide services to our App to place cookies on your device that assist us in analyzing usage data. We do not allow these business partners to collect your personal information from our App except as may be necessary for the services that they provide.</p>

<p>You can manage these cookies. For example, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. If you disable cookies, it may interfere with the functionality of our App and you may not be able to use all of the App’s features.</p>

<p>We may also use web beacons or similar technology to help us track the effectiveness of our communications. A web beacon (also known as an action tag, a clear gif or pixel tag) is a1x1 pixel image embedded in a web page used to transparently collect information. For example, we may use a web beacon to count the number of visits to the various features of our App. If you have signed up to receive any of our e-mail newsletters, we use similar technology to count how many recipients have opened the message and clicked on one of its links.</p>

<p>Tracking by advertising services

Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. By using this App, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set forth above.
